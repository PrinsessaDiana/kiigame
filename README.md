How to test locally on Linux
----------------------------

The game is implemented as a web page. Therefore you need to run a web server on your machine to test it locally. Here are the steps:

 * Install and run Apache (for example see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP)
 * Put the files (including folders) to your webserver directory (for example /var/www/)
 * Open the kiigame.html in your browser (for example http://localhost/kiigame.html)
